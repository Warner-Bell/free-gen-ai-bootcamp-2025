# free-gen-ai-bootcamp-2025

The Initial test results while relativly good, deviated from the expected results in various ways, noted in each model's readme.

I'm going to blow away the initial test chats for each ai and repeat the initial process with the updated prompt text.
I will remove any and all chats dealing with the language translator from all models, as I have witnessed context caryy over from previous chats in the past, particularly with Chat GPT.

The Secondary tests show more promise.
