# **Backend API: Defining JSON Responses and Tasks**

## **Objective**
The goal is to generate detailed JSON responses for each API endpoint, ensuring they match the frontend's expectations as specified in the `frontend-tech-spec.md` file. This will enhance API documentation and provide clarity for development and integration.

## **Approach**
1. **Use Amazon Q Developer**  
   - I utilized Amazon Q Developer (paid version) to generate example JSON responses.
   - The assistant cross-referenced the backend and frontend specifications to ensure alignment.

2. **Following Andrewâ€™s Instructions**  
   - Andrewâ€™s approach was used as a reference.
   - Steps were replicated in my own style while ensuring consistency with project requirements.

## **Task Execution**

### **Step 1: Generate Example JSON Responses**
- **Prompt Used in Amazon Q Developer:**
  ```
  @workspace, I need to expand my API endpoint documentation in the 'backend-tech-spec.md' file to reflect the exact JSON response that will be returned by each of the endpoints. 
  Reference the details in the doc above the API endpoints section for context.
  Also, cross-reference the 'frontend-tech-spec.md' file for further context and output inclusions.
  ```
  
- **Response Example from Q Developer:**
  ```
  I'll help you document the JSON response structures for each API endpoint based on the frontend requirements. I'll organize this by endpoint, showing the expected response format that will satisfy the frontend needs.
  ```
