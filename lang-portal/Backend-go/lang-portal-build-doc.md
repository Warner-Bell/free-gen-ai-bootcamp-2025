My chosen AI coding assistant is amazon Q, I have a paid developer version.

my plan is to follow Andew's instruction using his example for context to guide me in duplicating the steps in my own style.


# Backend API Defining JSON Responses and Tasks
The first task was to generate example JSON responses that would be returned by our api endpoints.
- I used Q Developer for this task

Prompt: v3

@workspace , I need to expand my api endpoint documentation in the 'backend-tech-spec.md' file to reflect the exact json response that will be returned by each of the endpoints. Reference the details in the doc above the api endpoints section for context, Also, cross reference the 'frontend-tech-spec.md' file for further context and output inclusions.

Response: Example

I'll help you document the JSON response structures for each API endpoint based on the frontend requirements. I'll organize this by endpoint, showing the expected response format that will satisfy the frontend needs. [1]

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the expected JSON responses for each endpoint, including pagination structures where applicable. All timestamps are in ISO 8601 format, and the responses are structured to provide all the necessary data required by the frontend components as specified in the frontend technical specification.
