# Backend Server Tech Specs

## Business Goal:

A language learning school wants to build a prototype of learning portal which will act as the following three things:
- An Inventory of possible vocabulary that can be learned
- a Learning record store (LRS), providing correct and wrong score on practice vocabulary
- A unified launchpad to launch different learning apps

## Technical Requirements

- The backend will be built using Go
- The database will be SQLite3
- The API will be built using Gin
- Mage is a task runner for Go.
- The API will always return JSON
- There will no authentication or authorization
- Everything be treated as a single user

## Database Schema

Our database will be a single sqlite database called `words.db` that will be in the root of the project folder of `backend_go`

We have the following tables:
- words - stored vocabulary words
  - id integer
  - japanese string
  - romaji string
  - english string
  - parts json
- words_groups - join table for words and groups many-to-many
  - id integer
  - word_id integer
  - group_id integer
- groups - thematic groups of words
  - id integer
  - name string
- study_sessions - records of study sessions grouping word_review_items
  - id integer
  - group_id integer
  - created_at datetime
  - study_activity_id integer
- study_activities - a specific study activity, linking a study session to group
  - id integer
  - study_session_id integer
  - group_id integer
  - created_at datetime
- word_review_items - a record of word practice, determining if the word was correct or not
  - word_id integer
  - study_session_id integer
  - correct boolean
  - created_at datetime
