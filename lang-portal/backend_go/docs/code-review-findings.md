# Code Review Analysis

## Project Overview
This is a language learning portal backend written in Go. The system consists of several key components:

### Core Components
1. Study Activities
2. Words Management 
3. Groups Management
4. Study Sessions
5. Dashboard Analytics

### Tech Stack
- Language: Go
- Database: SQLite
- Architecture: RESTful API

## Architecture Review
The codebase follows a clean architecture pattern with:
- `cmd/server/`: Application entry point
- `internal/handlers/`: HTTP request handlers
- `internal/models/`: Data models and business logic
- `migrations/`: Database schema migrations

## Next Steps
Further analysis needed for:
1. Data models implementation
2. Handler implementations
3. Test coverage
4. Error handling patterns
