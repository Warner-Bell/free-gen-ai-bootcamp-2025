# Detailed Code Review Findings

## API Implementation Review

### Positive Aspects
1. Clear separation of concerns with models and handlers
2. Consistent error handling patterns in handlers
3. Well-structured data models with proper JSON tags
4. Use of proper Go idioms and package organization

### Areas for Improvement

#### Error Handling
1. Some handlers could benefit from more specific error types
2. Consider adding middleware for consistent error responses
3. Add request validation before database operations

#### Testing
1. Unit test coverage could be expanded
2. Add integration tests for API endpoints
3. Consider adding benchmark tests for critical paths

#### Code Organization
1. Could benefit from dedicated service layer for complex business logic
2. Consider adding interfaces for better testability
3. Documentation could be enhanced with more examples

#### Security Considerations
1. Input validation could be strengthened
2. SQL injection prevention measures should be reviewed
3. Consider adding rate limiting for production

## Recommendations
1. Add comprehensive input validation
2. Implement structured logging
3. Add metrics collection
4. Consider adding caching layer
5. Implement graceful shutdown
