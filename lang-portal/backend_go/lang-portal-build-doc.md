# **Backend API: Defining JSON Responses and Tasks**

## **Objective**
The goal is to generate detailed JSON responses for each API endpoint, ensuring they match the frontend's expectations as specified in the `frontend-tech-spec.md` file. This will enhance API documentation and provide clarity for development and integration.

## **Approach**
1. **Use Amazon Q Developer**  
   - I utilized Amazon Q Developer (paid version) to generate example JSON responses.
   - The assistant cross-referenced the backend and frontend specifications to ensure alignment.

2. **Following Andrewâ€™s Instructions**  
   - Andrewâ€™s approach was used as a reference.
   - Steps were replicated in my own style while ensuring consistency with project requirements.

---

## **Task Execution**

### **Step 1: Generate Example JSON Responses**
- **Prompt Used in Amazon Q Developer:**
  ```
  @workspace, I need to expand my API endpoint documentation in the 'backend-tech-spec.md' file to reflect the exact JSON response that will be returned by each of the endpoints. 
  Reference the details in the doc above the API endpoints section for context.
  Also, cross-reference the 'frontend-tech-spec.md' file for further context and output inclusions.
  ```
  
- **Response Example from Q Developer:**
  ```
  I'll help you document the JSON response structures for each API endpoint based on the frontend requirements. I'll organize this by endpoint, showing the expected response format that will satisfy the frontend needs.
  ```

### **Study Activities Endpoints**

#### **GET /api/study_activities**  
**Description:** Retrieves a list of all available study activities.  

**Response:**
```json
{
  "activities": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string",
      "thumbnail_url": "string",
      "description": "string"

# **Backend API Implement Backend with Q**

## **Objective**
The goal is to .

## **Approach**
1. **Use Amazon Q Developer**  

2. **Following Andrewâ€™s Instructions**  

---

## **Task Execution**

### **Build API Backend**
**Prompt:**
  ```
  @workspace, I need to build an api backend for my language portal app. all required tech specs are in the 'backend-tech-spec.md' file and ux context can be found in the 'frontend-tech-spec.md' . Give me a detailed summary of your suggestions and course of action. Wait until I give you the ok before generating any code.
  ```
  
**Response Snippet:**
  ```
  I'll provide a structured plan for building the API backend for your language portal app. Here's my suggested approach.
  ```

```
Technology Stack Selection

Go as the primary language (as indicated in the file path)

RESTful API architecture

PostgreSQL for the database (suitable for relational data like word associations)

Gin web framework for Go (excellent performance and middleware support)

GORM as the ORM layer

JWT for authentication

Docker for containerization

Project Structure Organization

backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ cmd/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/           # Application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ internal/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/          # HTTP handlers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/   # Auth & logging middleware
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/       # Data models
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository/   # Database interactions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ service/      # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ pkg/              # Shared utilities
â””â”€â”€ configs/          # Configuration files

Would you like me to proceed with generating any specific part of this implementation plan? I can provide more detailed breakdowns of any component or move forward with code generation once you give the go-ahead.
```
---

## **Observations**
- Q created a unique plan for building the api backend, compared to Andrew's example with Claude.
- Q did not use the directory structure outlined in my backend file.
- 

## **Course of Action**
1. Ask Q why it did not use the directory structure in the file.(`Why didn't you use the file structure shown in the backend-tech-spec.md file?`)

**Response Snippet:**
```
I apologize for not following the file structure specified in the backend-tech-spec.md file. You're right - I should have adhered to the provided specifications rather than suggesting a different structure. Let me revise the project structure section to match what's in the spec:

backend/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/    # Request handlers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/        # Database models
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ services/      # Business logic
â”œâ”€â”€ config/            # Configuration files
â”œâ”€â”€ db/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/    # Database migrations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ seeds/        # Seed data
â””â”€â”€ test/             # Test files

This structure aligns with the project requirements and maintains consistency with the team's established patterns. The rest of the implementation plan can remain similar, but would be adapted to work within this structure instead.

Would you like me to revise the implementation plan to better align with this structure and any other specifications from the backend-tech-spec.md file

```

2. Based on confidence in the response to my inquiry, determine if I will go with Q's unique output, or instruct it to adhere to the perameters in Andrew's example. (Result:`file structure partially used-resulting in low confidence`)

3. Instruct Q in producing the desired result. (Prompt:`Revise the implementation plan to properly align with this correct structure and the SQLite database choice`)
---

**Response Snippet:**
```
Here's the revised implementation plan aligned with the correct structure and SQLite database:

Technology Stack

Go as primary language

SQLite for database (using words.db)

Chi router or standard net/http (based on simplicity needs)

database/sql with sqlite3 driver

Built-in Go modules for core functionality

â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â””â”€â”€ words.db

Would you like me to proceed with generating code for any specific component of this implementation plan?
```

## **Building The App**

**Prompt:**
  ```
  Please proceed to build the app in the backend-go directory.
  ```
  
**Response Snippet:**
  ```
  I'll help you build the application step by step. Let's start with setting up the core structure and initial files.
  ```

```
#!/bin/bash

# Create root directory
mkdir -p backend_go

# Create main directory structure
cd backend_go
mkdir -p cmd/server
mkdir -p internal/{models,handlers,service}
mkdir -p internal/handlers/{dashboard,words,groups,activities,sessions}
mkdir -p db/{migrations,seeds}

# Create initial files
touch cmd/server/main.go
touch magefile.go
touch go.mod
touch db/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql
touch db/seeds/initial_words.sql

# Initialize go module
go mod init lang-portal

# Create empty words.db
touch words.db

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the actual code files within this structure? Please confirm if the directory structure is created successfully and I'll continue with the implementation.

Note: You'll need to run this script from the parent directory where you want backend_go to be created. Let me know once the directory structure is set up and I'll proceed with implementing the code.
```

## **Observations**
- Q created a script that can be run to create the directories, but did not create them itself(not sure it can).
- It suggests in its output it can create the code files, but I'm doubtful.

## **Course of Action**
1. Run the commands to create the directories and proceed.(`Why didn't you use the file structure shown in the backend-tech-spec.md file?`)
2. Save progress so I don't lose this entire file again like I did an hour ago!

**Result:**

Directories and files created.
