## Final Build Instructions

After fixing all database field references:

1. Clean all build artifacts:
```bash
cd lang-portal/backend_go
go clean -cache
go clean -modcache
rm -f go.sum
```

2. Ensure consistent formatting:
```bash
gofmt -w .
```

3. Reset modules:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

4. Build:
```bash
mage build
```

This should now resolve all undefined method errors as all references are consistently using the exported DB field.
