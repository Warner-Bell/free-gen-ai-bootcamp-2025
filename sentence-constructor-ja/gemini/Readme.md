## Initial Prompt:
You are and expert language teacher skilled in many languages, but are particulary talented with English, japanese, and Spanish. 
You will perform your teaching as language teaching app, for which I will provide you instruction and examples in the form of a prompt and attachments. 
After receiving instruction you will begin performing your app function based on the provided inputs, acknowledge your understanding and stand by to begin.


## Follow-up Prompt
Here is the prompt, I will follow with examples, considerations, and tests, prompt when ready for each;


## Prompt Reinforcement
Now here is the prompt again follow the instruction and provide the expected output;


## Test Sentence
Did you see the latest version of Mr. Beast games? The players are becoming greedy.


## Output:
Okay, I'm in the Setup state. Here's the information to get the student started:

Export to Sheets
Sentence Structure:

[Subject] [Object] [Verb]? , [Subject] [Verb].

Considerations and Next Steps:

This sentence is a compound sentence, containing a question and a statement.
The question asks if someone saw something (the latest version of the Mr. Beast game). Think about how to form a question in Japanese.
The statement describes the players becoming greedy. This is a description of a change. Consider how to express "becoming" in Japanese.
Remember that the direct translation might not be the most natural way to say this in Japanese. Think about the nuance of the sentence.
The "latest version" can be considered a single concept.
"Mr. Beast" is typically written in katakana.
Remember, you'll need to figure out the correct particles to connect the words and phrases. The vocabulary table does not include particles.
Now, it's the student's turn to make an attempt.  Let me know what they come up with!

## Initial Observations

The model seems to perform as expected. 
The model is aware of its initial state.
The model produces a chart, explanation, considerations, and suggestions.
The model's output could still be considered verbose, However, I theorize the language in the prompt instructing the model to reference a file could be the reason, I will test this theory in the next round.
So far Gemeni has met initial expectation. 


## Secondary Output
State: Setup

Cheatsheet:

Japanese	Romaji	English
見る	miru	to see
最新	saishin	latest
バージョン	bājon	version
Mr. Beast	Misutā Bīsuto	Mr. Beast
ゲーム	gēmu	game
選手	senshu	player
欲深い	yokubukai	greedy
なる	naru	to become

Export to Sheets
Sentence structure:

[Subject] [Object] [Verb]? , [Subject] [Verb].

Considerations:

This sentence is compound, consisting of a question about seeing something and a statement about a change in progress.
The question part uses the verb "to see" in the past tense.
The statement part uses the verb "to become" to describe a change happening with the players. Consider how to express "becoming" or a progressive tense in Japanese.
Think about the correct particles to mark the subject and object in each clause.
Remember that "Mr. Beast" is typically written in katakana.
Possible next steps:

Attempt a full translation.
Ask about how to conjugate "to see" into the past tense.
Ask about how to express "becoming" or a progressive tense.
Ask about how to connect the two clauses.

## Secondary Observations
The model seems to perform as expected. 
The model is aware of its initial state.
The model produces a chart--it is more robust than meta's, structure, considerations, and Next Steps.
The model's "Considerations" output is no more concise than it was previously, I hypothesize a need for more explicit instruction for this model/version.
So far Gemini is close to meeting initial expectation. 
The model will be presented a follow-up question(why arent the conciderations more concise?)
The model returned: "You are absolutely right. The considerations could be more concise. My apologies.  I will strive for brevity and clarity in future explanations.  Thank you for the feedback!  I'll keep it in mind for the next interaction."
The model was re-presented the initial sentence.


## Tertiary Output
State: Setup

Cheatsheet:

Japanese	Romaji	English
見る	miru	to see
最新	saishin	latest
バージョン	bājon	version
Mr. Beast	Misutā Bīsuto	Mr. Beast
ゲーム	gēmu	game
選手	senshu	player
欲深い	yokubukai	greedy
なる	naru	to become

Export to Sheets
Sentence structure:

[Subject] [Object] [Verb]? , [Subject] [Verb].

Considerations:

Two clauses: past tense question and a statement of progressive change.
"To see" needs past tense conjugation.
"To become" needs progressive form.
Consider appropriate particles.
"Mr. Beast" is usually in katakana.
Possible next steps:

Attempt a translation.
Ask about past tense of "to see."
Ask about progressive tense of "to become."
Ask about clause connection.

## Tertiary Observations
The model seems to perform as expected. 
The model is aware of its initial state.
The model produces a chart--it is more robust than meta's, structure, considerations, and Next Steps.
The model's output is now concise
Now Gemini is meeting initial expectation.
