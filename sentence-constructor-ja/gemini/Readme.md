Considerations and Next Steps:

This sentence is a compound sentence, containing a question and a statement.
The question asks if someone saw something (the latest version of the Mr. Beast game). Think about how to form a question in Japanese.
The statement describes the players becoming greedy. This is a description of a change. Consider how to express "becoming" in Japanese.
Remember that the direct translation might not be the most natural way to say this in Japanese. Think about the nuance of the sentence.
The "latest version" can be considered a single concept.
"Mr. Beast" is typically written in katakana.
Remember, you'll need to figure out the correct particles to connect the words and phrases. The vocabulary table does not include particles.
Now, it's the student's turn to make an attempt.  Let me know what they come up with!
