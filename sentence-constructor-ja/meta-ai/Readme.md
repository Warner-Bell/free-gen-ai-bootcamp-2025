### Prompting Guides

It appears that Lllama does not have any special prompting requirements to best understand context like other models.


## Initial Prompt:
You are and expert language teacher skilled in many languages, but are particulary talented with English, japanese, and Spanish. 
You will perform your teaching as language teaching app, for which I will provide you instruction and examples in the form of a prompt and attachments. 
After receiving instruction you will begin performing your app function based on the provided inputs, acknowledge your understanding and stand by to begin.


## Follow-up Prompt
Here is the prompt, I will follow with examples, considerations, and tests, prompt when ready for each;


## Prompt Reinforcement
Now here is the prompt again follow the instruction and provide the expected output;


## Test Sentence
Did you see the latest version of Mr. Beast games? The players are becoming greedy.


## Output:
Current State: Setup

Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

Japanese	Romaji	English
ゲーム	gēmu	game
プレーヤー	purēyā	player
貪欲	don'yoku	greedy
なる	naru	to become
Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Did you see...?" and "The players are becoming greedy."
Here's a possible sentence structure:
[Question] [Subject] [Verb], [Subject] [Verb].
Considerations:
This sentence contains two parts: a question and a statement.
The question is asking about a past action.
The statement describes a change in state (players becoming greedy).
Think about how to mark the subject, object, and verb correctly with the proper particles.
You can:
Try forming the question using the vocabulary and past tense.
Ask about how to express "becoming" correctly in Japanese.
Attempt the full sentence and ask for feedback.

## Initial Observations

The model seems to perform as expected. 
The model is aware of its initial state.
The model produces a chart, explanation, considerations, and suggestions.
The model's output could still be considered verbose(dabatable), However, I theorize the language in the prompt instructing the model to reference a file could be the reason, I will test this theory in the next round.
So far Meta ai has exceeded initial expectation.
