It appears that Lllama does not have any special prompting requirements to best understand context like other models.


## Initial Prompt:
You are and expert language teacher skilled in many languages, but are particulary talented with English, japanese, and Spanish. 
You will perform your teaching as language teaching app, for which I will provide you instruction and examples in the form of a prompt and attachments. 
After receiving instruction you will begin performing your app function based on the provided inputs, acknowledge your understanding and stand by to begin.


## Follow-up Prompt
Here is the prompt, I will follow with examples, considerations, and tests, prompt when ready for each;


## Prompt Reinforcement
Now here is the prompt again follow the instruction and provide the expected output;


## Test Sentence
Did you see the latest version of Mr. Beast games? The players are becoming greedy.


## Initial Output:
Current State: Setup

Let's break down the sentence into smaller parts. Here's a possible table of vocabulary to get you started:

Japanese	Romaji	English
ゲーム	gēmu	game
プレーヤー	purēyā	player
貪欲	don'yoku	greedy
なる	naru	to become
Now, let's think about the sentence structure. We have two clauses: "Did you see...?" and "The players are becoming greedy."
Here's a possible sentence structure:
[Question] [Subject] [Verb], [Subject] [Verb].
Considerations:
This sentence contains two parts: a question and a statement.
The question is asking about a past action.
The statement describes a change in state (players becoming greedy).
Think about how to mark the subject, object, and verb correctly with the proper particles.
You can:
Try forming the question using the vocabulary and past tense.
Ask about how to express "becoming" correctly in Japanese.
Attempt the full sentence and ask for feedback.

## Initial Observations

The model seems to perform as expected. 
The model is aware of its initial state.
The model produces a chart, explanation, considerations, and things to try.
The model's output could still be considered verbose, However, I theorize the language in the prompt instructing the model to reference a file could be the reason, I will test this theory in the next round.
So far Meta ai has exceeded initial expectation.  


## Secondary Output
Our current state is Setup.
Here's a table of vocabulary to help you get started:
Japanese	Romaji	English
ゲーム	gēmu	game
プレーヤー	purēyā	player
貪欲	donnoku	greedy
なる	naru	to become
A possible sentence structure could be:
[Topic] [Subject] [Verb]。
Some considerations and next steps:
Think about how to express the idea of "becoming" greedy in Japanese.
Consider how to use the vocabulary words in context.
How will you structure the sentence to convey the meaning of the original English sentence?
Your turn! What's your attempt at translating the sentence into Japanese?

## Secondary Observations

The model seems to perform as expected. 
The model is aware of its initial state.
The model produces a chart, structure, considerations, and Next Steps.
The model's output is now very concise, My theory proves to be correct.
So far Meta ai is exceeded initial expectation.
