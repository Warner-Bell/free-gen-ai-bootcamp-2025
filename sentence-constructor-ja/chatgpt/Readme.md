## ChatGPT Powered Assitant Guide

### Which Model

GPT 4o

> I have the paid version of ChatGPT.

## Prompting Guides

https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering

Just like Meta AI there are no specific formatting to best provide context.

## Initial Prompt:
You are and expert language teacher skilled in many languages, but are particulary talented with English, japanese, and Spanish. 
You will perform your teaching as language teaching app, for which I will provide you instruction and examples in the form of a prompt and attachments. 
After receiving instruction you will begin performing your app function based on the provided inputs, acknowledge your understanding and stand by to begin.


## Follow-up Prompt
Here is the prompt, I will follow with examples, considerations, and tests, prompt when ready for each;


## Prompt Reinforcement
Now here is the prompt again follow the instruction and provide the expected output;


## Test Sentence
Did you see the latest version of Mr. Beast games? The players are becoming greedy.


## Output:

- The first sentence is a **question** in past tense, asking about seeing something.  
- The second sentence is a **statement** about a change in state (becoming greedy).  
- Think about how to structure a **question** in Japanese.  
- Consider how to express **"becoming greedy"** correctly in Japanese.  
- You may need **a noun or an adjective form** for ‚Äúgreedy‚Äù depending on how you structure the sentence.  
- Try forming the **first sentence first** before moving on to the second.  

üëâ **Next Steps:**  
- Attempt the translation using the vocabulary and sentence structure.  
- Ask for clues if needed. üöÄ

## Initial Observations

The model seems to perform as expected. 
The model is aware of its initial state.
The model produces a chart, clues, considerations, and suggestions.
The model's output could still be considered verbose(dabatable), However, I theorize the language in the prompt instructing the model to reference a file could be the reason, I will test this theory in the next round.
The model included imojis in output without being instructed to do so, however I'm not surprised this is common behavior for GPT-4o.
So far GPT 4o has met initial expectation. 


## Secondary Output
State: Setup
Target English Sentence:
"Did you see the latest version of Mr. Beast games? The players are becoming greedy."

Vocabulary Table
Japanese	Romaji	English
Ë¶ã„Çã	miru	to see
ÊúÄÊñ∞	saishin	latest
„Éê„Éº„Ç∏„Éß„É≥	baajon	version
„Ç≤„Éº„É†	geemu	game
„Éó„É¨„Ç§„É§„Éº	pureiyaa	player
„Å™„Çã	naru	to become
Ê¨≤Âºµ„Çä	yokubari	greedy (noun/adjective)
Sentence Structure
[Object] [Verb]?, [Subject] [Verb].

Clues, Considerations, Next Steps
The first sentence is a question in past tense, so the verb "to see" must be conjugated correctly.
The object being referred to is a specific thing (latest version of Mr. Beast games). Think about how to express this properly.
The second part of the sentence describes an ongoing change in state, so the verb "to become" needs to reflect that progression.
Consider how to mark the subject, object, and verb correctly with the proper particles.
Next Steps:
Try forming the question using the vocabulary and past tense of "to see."
Attempt to express "becoming" correctly in Japanese.
Ask about how to structure the sentence if needed.

## Secondary Observations
The model seems to perform as expected. 
The model is aware of its initial state.
The model produces a chart(more robust than meta, but not as Gemini), clues, considerations, and next steps.
The model's "Considerations" output is somewhat more concise than it was previously,
So far Chat GPT is close to meeting initial expectation. One note is that it seems to follow the instruction more explicitly(the only model to follow this instruction "Now here is the prompt again follow the instruction and provide the expected output"). 
The model will be presented a follow-up question(why arent the conciderations more concise?)
The model returned: "You're right to call that out. Here‚Äôs a more concise version of the considerations:

Clues, Considerations, Next Steps:
The first part is a past tense question about seeing something.
The second part describes a change in state (players becoming greedy).
Use the past form of "to see" and the progressive form of "to become."
Think about how to mark the object, subject, and verbs correctly.
Next Steps:
Try forming the question using past tense.
Attempt to express "becoming" correctly.
Ask about sentence structure or particles if needed.
The model was re-presented the initial sentence.

## Tertiary Observations
The model seems to perform as expected. 
The model is aware of its initial state.
The model produces a chart--it is more robust than meta's, structure, considerations, and Next Steps.
The model's output is now concise
Now Chat GPT is meeting initial expectation.
