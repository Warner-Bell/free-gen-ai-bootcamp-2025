### Vocabulary Table
- the table should only include nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives
- the table of of vocabular should only have the following columns: Japanese, Romaji, English
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary table, student needs to figure the correct particles to use
- ensure there are no repeats eg. if miru verb is repeated twice, show it only once
- if there is more than one version of a word, show the most common example

### Sentence Structure
- do not provide particles in the sentence structure
- do not provide tenses or conjugations in the sentence structure
- remember to consider beginner level sentence structures

Here is an example of simple sentence structures.
- The episode is new. → [Subject] [Adjective].  
- The episode is in the series. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb].  
- Watch the new episode. → [Object] [Verb].  
- Did you see the new episode? → [Subject] [Object] [Verb]?  
- This morning, I watched the new episode. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb].  
- Are the players becoming greedy? → [Subject] [Verb]?  
- Did you enjoy the episode? → [Object] [Verb]?  
- The players are becoming greedy in the game. → [Subject] [Verb] [Location].  
- The episode is about the game, and the players are becoming more greedy. → [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Subject] [Verb].  
- I watched the episode because the players were becoming greedy. → [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb] [Reason] [Subject] [Verb].  

### Clues and Considerations

- talk about the vocabulary but leave out the japanese words because the student can refer to the vocabulary table.
